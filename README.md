# Ricochet
A game featuring Victor Noir (&amp;friends)

Victor Noir was a Parisian journalist in 1869 who got mixed up in a dispute between the radical newspaper
La Revanche and the great-nephew of Napolean Bonaparte, Prince Pierre Bonaparte.
Victor and a friend visited Bonaparte at the behest of the editor of La Revanche, 
an argument broke out between them and Bonaparte shot Victor dead.
His death sparked a political outcry and Noir became a symbol for French Republican rebels.
Soon after Victor was buried in Pere Lachaise cemetery under a copper representation of his body at the moment of his death.
The likeness is famous for a certain protuberance in its trousers, 
which led Victor Noir to become a kind of fertility symbol in later years.

Ricochet! focuses on the events surrounding Victor's death. 
It is a 2 player game, with each player controlling either Victor or Pierre.

Both have 'Seconds' to help guide the 'moon bullet' to its destination.

Each player has 10 'health' which will decrease to zero when the player is hit by the offending moon.
The player's own moon won't hurt him, but which is which?

Align the flow of history, or help change the tragic fate of young Mr. Noir!
